# ðŸ¤– PRB0t
The Pull Request Bot for Anonymous contributions on GitHub!

---
With PRB0t you can make pull request on GitHub by using a `JSON` description of the changes.

## Install
```
npm install -S @prb0t/pr
```

## Usage
```
  const pr = new PR(body.user, body.repo, body.branch, body.token);

  pr.configure(
      [
        {"path": "<file-path>", "content": "<file-content>"}
      ],
      "<commit-message>",
      "<title>",
      "<description>",
      body.author || {
          name: 'PRB0t',
          email: '34620110+PRB0t@users.noreply.github.com',
      }
  );

  const { data } = await pr.send(); // data holds the response of the PR creation.
```

Or host your own version using [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now):

`now PRB0t/PRB0t`

You'll be asked for a Github token.

Request Sample:
```json
{
  "user": "<github-user>",
  "repo": "<github-repo>",
  "title": "<pull-request-title>",
  "description": "<pull-request-description>",
  "commit": "<commit-description>",
  "files": [
  	{"path": "<file-path>", "content": "<file-content>"}
  ]
}
```
